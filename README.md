# Stratego

This is a graphical, networked multiplayer implementation of the classic board game Stratego. It was completed as a final project with a team of three other students.
Work was collaborative and all members of the team had at least some hand in writing most of the Java files, but my work was mostly focused on the View and the Model.

An explanation of the higher-level design decisions and organization of the project is included in "Team 3 Stratego Presentation.pptx".
